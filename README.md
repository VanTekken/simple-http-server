# Simple HTTP Server in Go as a Container Image
`simple-http-server` returns ip address, headers and many other request data. use this as a test app to to deploy in your servers or practice to deploy

### How it works?
- starts listening on port 8081 for http traffic
- On every request it returns following things:
  - Request Type
  - Hostname or Host of request
  - Local IP of Container
  - Remote IP
  - All Request Headers
  - And Environment Varibale called `YOUR_ENV`

### How to use it?
- I've hosted this imager on docker hub or you can build it yourself if you want to
- 
    ```bash
    sudo docker run -p 8081:8081 pareshpawar/simple-http-server
    ``` 
- optionally, forward port via your proxy or load balancer
